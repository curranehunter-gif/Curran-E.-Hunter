Hi, I'm Curran (pronounced like word "current" without the *t*). I'm a creativity researcher and prospective PhD student drawn to the intersection of cognition, learning, the social sciences, and human–computer interaction.

I earned my B.S. in Human Development and Family Studies from Penn State University (2017) and will complete my M.Ed. in School Counseling at William & Mary in May 2026. The most formative part of my graduate journey has been working with Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, whose mentorship continues to invigorate my passion for my chosen path and the intricacies of the research process itself.

A fun fact about me: I'm often found by four-leaf clovers. I created a small business making handmade jewelry and artwork from thousands of handpicked four-, five-, six-, and even seven-leaf clovers. That project taught me how to honor subtle patterns, stay attuned to wonder, and trust the value of unusual ideas. I aim to imbue everything I study and create with that same spirit.
